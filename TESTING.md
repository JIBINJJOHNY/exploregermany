# Testing

## Manual Testing

Every feature that was added to the site was tested before it was integrated into the main file.

The user acceptability test listed below was used to test usability. It was distributed to new users to guarantee testing from a variety of users, on a variety of devices and browsers to ensure problems were identified and, if feasible, fixed during development.
